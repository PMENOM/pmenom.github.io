<li><p><a href="pdf/Harmonic Analysis on non-Riemannian symmetric spaces.pdf">[Lecture series: Harmonic Analysis on non-Riemannian symmetric spaces]</a> , 2025.1.</p>
This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~ban00101/">Erik P. van den Ban</a> from Utrecht.
The plan can be found <a href="https://www.cirm-math.fr/RepOrga/3227/Abstracts/Minicourse_vandenBan.pdf">HERE.</a> I studied this online.

<li><p><a href="pdf/Hochschild homology for red padic grp.pdf">[Hochschild homology of reductive p-adic groups note]</a>, 2025.3.</p>
<p>This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://www.math.ru.nl/~solleveld/">Maarten Solleveld</a> from Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen.
<p>The goal of this mini-course is to explain a description of the Hochschild homology of the Hecke algebra of a reductive p-adic group, in spectral terms related to the Bernstein center.</p>
<p>Lecture 1: Introduction to Hochschild homology and twisted crossed product algebras.
<p>Lecture 2: Representation theory and Hochschild homology of graded Hecke algebras.
<p>Lecture 3: Hochschild homology of algebras associated to p-adic groups.
<p>Details can be found in the series of papers on the topics 'Hecke algebras of p-adic groups' and 'Homology of Hecke algebras' parts at his homepage. Tbh I need more time to understand how this works.

<p> In p-adic day of Tempered representations and C* algebra, he gave a talk on <a href="pdf/Top K theory of reductive p adic group.pdf">[Topological K-Theory of reductive p-adic groups]</a>,
which described how the K-theory can be computed from the space of irreducible tempered representations. The final description is closely related to conjectures by Aubert-Baum-Plymen-Solleveld.

<li><p><a href="pdf/The Bernstein center.pdf">[The Berstein Center]</a> , 2025.3.</p>
<p>This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://perso.pages.math.cnrs.fr/users/david.renard/enseignement.html/">David Renard</a>.

<p>In this series of lectures, he explains J. Bernstein's description of the center of the category of smooth representations of reductive p-adic groups as rational functions on the variety of irreducible representations, by studying some induction and restriction functors in the categorical language.
It will be more concrete and complete together with Jessica's lecture on the construction of supercuspidal representations.
<p>The main reference is his book: Représentations des groupes réductifs p-adiques.

<li><p><a href="pdf/Minimal representations and applications.pdf">[Minimal representations and applications]</a> , 2025.3.</p>
<p>This talk given by <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~savin/">Gordan Savin</a> from Utah.

<p>He defines minimal representations of p-adic groups and explain how one can work with them.
<p>As an application, using minimal representations, he decomposes certain Weil representations attached to multiplicity-free symplectic representations as defined and classified by Knop, and calculated their irreducible quotients.
He explains that this result is predicted by [BZSV].
<p>The main reference is 'Multiplicity free Weil representations arising from exceptional groups'.

<li><p><a href="pdf/finite field theta.pdf">[The theta correspondence for classical groups over finite fields of odd characteristic]</a> , 2025.3.</p>
<p>This talk given by <a href="https://perso.imj-prg.fr/annemarie-aubert/">Anne Marie Aubert</a> from CNRS, IMJ-PRG.

<p>At first two lectures she introduces the finite Howe correspondence and focuses mostly on the unipotent representation, and wavefront sets.
In the case of Sp-O dual pairs, the correspondence between unipotent representations has been described conjecturally in [AMR96] in terms of a (in general non-bijective) correspondence between irreducible representations of two Weyl groups, and recently established in all cases by Pan and by Ma, Qiu and Zou, independently.
<p>In the third lecture, she explains several ways to extract a bijective correspondence, including the construction by Gurevich and Howe of the eta correspondence, and give some applications, for example, finite GGP conjeture.
She also explains that this result is a finite aspect of [BZSV]. Sadly the third one was too geometric to me.
<p>The main reference could be 'Howe correspondence and Springer correspondence for dual pairs over a finite field'.

<li><p><a href="pdf/local theta chenbo zhu note.pdf">[Local theta correspondence (Archimedean)]</a> , 2025.3.</p>
<p>This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/matzhucb/">Chen-Bo Zhu</a> from NUS.
<p>This mini-course is mostly like an elaborated sketch/outline/expository of archimedean place's theta correspondence theory, also applications.
<p>I: Howe duality theorem, Conservation relations. Ref: Conservation relations for local theta correspondence ([SZ]). Reading their ICM conference's talk: Theta correspondence and the orbit method, is also a pleasure.
<p>II: Correspondence of Generalized Whittaker Models and of Associated Cycles. Ref: Local theta lifting of generalized Whittaker models associated to nilpotent orbits ([GZ]), Special unipotent representations of real classical groups: construction and unitarity ([BMSZ]). Prof. Binyong Sun's talk on arthur packets also relies on this paper.
<p>III: On unitarity, non vanishing of theta. Ref: Singular unitary representations of classical groups ([J.S. Li, 1989]).
