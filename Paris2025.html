<li><p><a href="pdf/Harmonic Analysis on non-Riemannian symmetric spaces.pdf">[Lecture series: Harmonic Analysis on non-Riemannian symmetric spaces]</a> , 2025.1.</p>
This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~ban00101/">Erik P. van den Ban</a> from Utrecht.
The plan can be found <a href="https://www.cirm-math.fr/RepOrga/3227/Abstracts/Minicourse_vandenBan.pdf">HERE.</a> I studied this online.

<li><p><a href="pdf/Hochschild homology for red padic grp.pdf">[Hochschild homology of reductive p-adic groups note]</a>, 2025.3.</p>
This is the lecture talk given by <a href="https://www.math.ru.nl/~solleveld/">Maarten Solleveld</a> from Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen.
The goal of this mini-course is to explain a description of the Hochschild homology of the Hecke algebra of a reductive p-adic group, in spectral terms related to the Bernstein center.
Lecture 1: Introduction to Hochschild homology and twisted crossed product algebras.
Lecture 2: Representation theory and Hochschild homology of graded Hecke algebras.
Lecture 3: Hochschild homology of algebras associated to p-adic groups.
Details can be found in the 'Hecke algebras of p-adic groups' and 'Homology of Hecke algebras' parts at his homepage. Tbh I didn't catch the main idea.

<p> In p-adic day of Tempered representations and C* algebra, he gave a talk on <a href="pdf/Top K theory of reductive p adic group.pdf">[Topological K-Theory of reductive p-adic groups]</a>,
which described how the K-theory can be computed from the space of irreducible tempered-representations. The final description is closely related to conjectures by Aubert-Baum-Plymen-Solleveld.

<ul>
<li><p><a href="pdf/The Bernstein center .pdf">[Berstein Center]</a> , 2025.3.</p>
In this series of lectures, we will explain J. Bernstein's description of the center of the category of smooth representations of reductive p-adic groups as rational functions on the variety of irreducible representations.
The main reference is his book.
